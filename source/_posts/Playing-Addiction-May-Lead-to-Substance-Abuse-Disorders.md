#  Playing Addiction May Lead to Substance Abuse Disorders

There is a staggering amount of evidence to suggest that people who engage in playing addiction are at a higher risk for developing substance abuse disorders. 

People with addictions to games often times have other addictions or mental health disorders. A study from the University of Utah found that those who excessively played video games showed signs of addictive behavior, depression, and social isolation. The study also showed that the gamers were more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol .

A survey conducted by researchers at Iowa State University found that people addicted to video games were almost twice as likely to smoke, drink, and use illegal drugs. In addition, they were also more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression. 

Video game addiction is categorized as an impulse control disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. This means that it shares some similarities with disorders like gambling addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Just like any other addiction, gaming addiction can lead to devastating consequences such as job loss, financial instability, and strained relationships. 

If you or someone you know is addicted to video games, it’s important to get help right away. There are many Treatment Centers that specialize in helping people overcome gaming addiction.

#  Playing Addiction Associated With Greater Risk of Substance Abuse Disorders

People who play video games excessively may be at an increased risk for developing substance abuse disorders, according to a new study.

The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at survey data from more than 10,000 people in the United States. It found that those who reported excessive gaming were more likely to have misused drugs or alcohol and to have a diagnosis of a substance abuse disorder.

“This is one of the first studies to look at problem gaming and its associations with substance use disorders,” said study author Dr. Andrew Przybylski. “We found that gaming addiction was associated with significantly increased odds of drug and alcohol misuse problems. These findings are important because they suggest that excessive gaming might be an early marker for risk for more serious problems down the line.”

The study also found that those who played video games compulsively were more likely to experience psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety.

While the study does not prove that gaming causes substance abuse disorders, it does suggest that there may be a link between the two behaviors. More research is needed to determine whether excessive gaming leads to substance abuse or vice versa.

If you are concerned about your own or someone else’s level of gaming, there are steps you can take to get help. Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional about your concerns and ask about any resources or treatments available for video game addiction.

#  Relationship Between Playing Addiction and Substance Use Disorders Needs More Study

~~~

The relationship between playing addiction and substance use disorders is a complex one that needs more study according to a recent article in the journal [Addiction Research and Theory](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16063768.2018.1462493?journalCode=raca20). In the article, the authors discuss how there is a lack of empirical evidence when it comes to understanding how addiction to video games or other forms of digital play may be related to other addictions, such as substance abuse.

The authors note that many people who suffer from addiction to gaming or digital play also suffer from other addictions, such as to alcohol or drugs. However, they say that it is not clear if addiction to gaming or digital play is a risk factor for developing other addictions or if people with other addictions are more likely to develop an addiction to gaming or digital play. The authors point out that more research is needed in order to determine the nature of this relationship and how it might be treated.

Dr. Aaron White, one of the authors of the article, said in an interview with [PsyPost](https://www.psypost.org/2018/07/relationship-between-playing-addiction-substance-use-disorders-needs-study-52617), "There's a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests there might be a connection, but we really don't know yet what's going on." He added, "It's possible that addictive gaming and other digital activities are risk factors for developing other addictions, but it's also possible that those with other addictions are more likely to develop addictive gaming habits."

White also said that researchers need to look at how different types of addictive behavior might interact with each other. "Are there certain combinations of addictions that seem particularly dangerous or problematic? And can treatments be tailored specifically for those patients?" he asked.

The article in Addiction Research and Theory provides a useful overview of the current state of knowledge about the relationship between playing addiction and substance use disorders. However, more research is needed in order to answer questions about the nature of this relationship and its potential implications for treatment.

#  Effects of Playing Addiction and Substance Use Disorders Undetermined

A person’s lifestyle is determined by many factors such as their genetic makeup, environment, psychological factors, and social networks. In some cases, a substance use disorder or addiction develops as a result of interacting with one or more of these factors. However, it is still unclear how exactly playing addiction and substance use disorders are developed.

Most people with addiction or substance use disorders started using drugs or alcohol before the age of 18. Some experts suggest that early exposure to addictive substances can change the brain’s chemistry and lead to long-term problems with addiction and substance abuse. This theory is supported by evidence that shows people who start using drugs or alcohol in adolescence are more likely to develop addiction and other problems later in life.

Other experts believe that playing addiction and substance use disorders are caused by a combination of environmental, psychological, and social factors. For example, someone who grows up in a chaotic home may be more likely to develop an addiction or substance use disorder later in life. Alternatively, someone who has few social supports may be more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol as a way to cope with stress and anxiety.

Despite extensive research on the topic, the cause of playing addiction and substance use disorders remains largely unknown. More studies are needed to determine how exactly these conditions develop and how they can be treated effectively.

#  Playing addiction may increase risk of substance use disorders

It is no secret that most people enjoy playing video games. In fact, the global gaming industry is expected to bring in nearly $100 billion in revenue by 2020. While there are many benefits to gaming, including improved hand-eye coordination and cognitive skills, some researchers are concerned that excessive gaming may lead to addiction and other substance use disorders.

A study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry examined the link between gaming addiction and subsequent substance use disorders. The study surveyed nearly 19,000 people from 10 different countries and found that those with an addiction to gaming were almost twice as likely to develop a substance use disorder within a year. These findings suggest that playing video games can be addictive and potentially lead to other behavioral issues.

It’s important to note that not all gamers will experience negative consequences from excessive play. However, for those who do struggle with addiction, it’s important to seek help. If you or someone you know is addicted to video games, please seek professional counseling or treatment.
