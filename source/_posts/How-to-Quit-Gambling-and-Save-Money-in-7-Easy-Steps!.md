When it comes to quitting gambling, the most important thing is to have a plan. Here are 7 easy steps to help you quit gambling and save money:

The first step is to set a goal for yourself. What do you want to achieve by quitting gambling? Whether it’s saving money, improving your mental health or getting your life back on track, make sure your goal is realistic and achievable.

4. Find substitutes for gambling

If you can’t avoid temptation, find substitutes for gambling that won’t cost you money. This might involve playing sport or going for walks in nature instead of spending time online or at the casino. Activities like these can help keep your mind occupied without costing you anything.
