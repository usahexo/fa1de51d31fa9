#  Bingo Blitz Commercial Hits All The Right Notes 

It’s not often that commercials are so enjoyable that they can be watched over and over again. However, the commercial for Bingo Blitz, a popular online bingo game, is one of those rare gems. Starring actress Alison Brie, the ad is both funny and clever.

The premise of the commercial is that Brie is a struggling actress who is trying to get her big break. In order to make ends meet, she takes a job as a bingo caller at Bingo Blitz. Her monologue about the game is both funny and endearing.

What makes the commercial even better is the fact that it’s actually based on a true story. The actress who portrays Brie in the commercial, Alison Brie, is actually married to Dave Franco, who also appears in the spot. The two met while working together on the set of the movie “The Disaster Artist”.

Since it was released, the Bingo Blitz commercial has been viewed over 7 million times on YouTube. It has also been featured on several major news networks, including NBC and ABC.

#  This Bingo Blitz Commercial Has Got Soul 

I’ll admit it - I am a sucker for a good Bingo Blitz commercial. And the latest one, with its nod to classic soul and Motown tunes, is no exception. 

The commercial begins with a sung introduction declaring that “There’s only one game that can take you to heaven!” It then shows people of all ages (and races) enjoying a game of bingo together. The song continues as the scene switches between players happily shouting out B-I-N-G-O and clips of the sights and sounds of different cities around the world. 

What I love most about this commercial is that it perfectly captures the joy and community that comes with playing bingo. Whether you’re in a fancy casino or an old folks home, there’s just something special about gathering together to mark off numbers on a grid. 

And of course, the catchy song doesn’t hurt either! If this commercial doesn’t have you itching to play some bingo, I don’t know what will.

In a cool new commercial, several classic singers are shown performing together in a "virtual duet." The singers include Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Adele.

The fast-paced commercial begins with Barbra Streisand belting out the opening lines to "Don't Rain On My Parade." From there, the other singers join her one by one in a powerhouse performance of the song. Next is Celine Dion singing "The Power of Love," followed by Whitney Houston's soaring version of "I Will Always Love You."
