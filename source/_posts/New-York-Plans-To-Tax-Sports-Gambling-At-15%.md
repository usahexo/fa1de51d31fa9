#  New York Plans To Tax Sports Gambling At 15%

On Wednesday, New York state lawmakers announced that they are proposing a 15% tax on sports gambling profits. This would be in addition to the 8.5% state tax on casino gambling profits.

The proposal was announced by Senate Deputy Majority Leader John DeFrancisco and Assemblyman Gary Pretlow. They say that it would help to offset the costs of regulating and policing sports gambling. The proposal has yet to be introduced as a bill, but it is expected to be brought before the legislature in early 2018.

Under the proposed legislation, any business that takes in more than $1 million in sports bets would have to pay the 15% tax. This would include racetracks, casinos, and online betting operators.

The New York Gaming Commission estimates that the new tax could bring in as much as $23 million annually. This money would be used to pay for the costs of regulating and policing sports gambling operations.

Casino operators in New York are already taxed at a rate of 50%. This means that if the new sports gambling tax is approved, their combined taxes would be 63.5%.

#  NY To Collect 15% Tax On Winnings From Sports Betting

The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) voted on Wednesday to levy a 15% tax on sports betting winnings, the highest in the nation. The decision came as part of the commission’s initial regulations for legalized sports gambling, which were unanimously approved.

Other states with legalized sports betting have lower tax rates, including West Virginia (10%), Delaware (6.75%) and Mississippi (8%). A number of states are still considering their own regulations, including California and Pennsylvania.

New York legislators expect the higher tax rate to bring in an additional $300 million in annual revenue. Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed the measure as part of his 2019-2020 state budget plan.

“There is no doubt that this new opportunity will bring much-needed revenue to our state, and I am proud that New York State will be leading the way in implementing a functional and fair sports betting market,” Cuomo said in a statement.

Cuomo has estimated that New York could generate as much as $1.3 billion in annual revenue from sports betting, which would be used to fund infrastructure projects.

Wednesday’s vote also included regulations for mobile sports betting, which will be allowed in New York starting on July 1st. Bettors will be able to place wagers through approved app providers such as FanDuel and DraftKings.

The regulations include a minimum age of 21 for placing bets, and a ban on bets being placed on college games within New York state borders.

#  New York Announces 15% Tax On Gambling Winnings

New York City leaders proposed a new 15% tax on gambling winnings on Wednesday. The proposed tax would apply to any individual or entity that wins $5,000 or more in a given day from games such as online poker, blackjack, and roulette.

City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said the tax is needed to help close the city's budget gap. "While we are fortunate to have a thriving casino and gaming industry in New York City, it is only fair that the people who benefit from it contribute to the cost of running our city," he said in a statement.

Casino operators denounced the proposal, saying it would drive business out of the city. "This proposed tax would be catastrophic for New York City's economy and its 11,000 casino jobs," said Jeff Ifrah, president of the American Gaming Association.

The tax would generate an estimated $112 million annually for the city. It still needs to be approved by the City Council and signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio.

#  New York Sports Gambling Tax Rate Set At 15%

On Monday, the New York state government announced that the tax rate for sports gambling would be set at 15%. This is lower than the rates in most other states, which typically range from 20% to 25%.

The move is seen as an attempt to lure sports betting businesses to New York. The state government believes that the new tax rate will make New York more competitive with other states, and that this will lead to increased revenue from sports gambling.

There has been mixed reaction to the news. Supporters of the tax rate say that it will help generate new revenue for the state. Critics argue that the rate is too low, and that it will not generate enough money to cover the costs of regulating and monitoring sports gambling activities.

Industry experts are also divided on the issue. Some believe that the lower tax rate will make New York more attractive to sports betting businesses, while others think that the market is already saturated, and that there is no room for further growth.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has defended the decision, arguing that it will help stimulate economic growth in the state. He also pointed out that New York already has a robust gaming industry, which generates over $3 billion in revenue each year.

The new tax rate will go into effect on October 1st, 2018.

#  State Of New York Levies 15% Tax On Sports Betting Winnings

In a major development, the state of New York has levied a 15% tax on all sports betting winnings. This is in addition to the standard 8.8% tax on gambling winnings that is already in place. The new tax is expected to bring in an additional $4 million in revenue each year.

This move comes as the state looks to shore up its budget shortfall. New York is facing a budget deficit of $4 billion this year, and the new tax is seen as a way to help offset that.

The move has been met with criticism from many in the gaming industry. They argue that it will lead to people taking their business elsewhere, potentially harming the state's economy.

Others argue that the new tax is long overdue, and that it will help ensure that the state gets its fair share of money from sports betting.

Regardless of which side of the debate you fall on, it's clear that this new tax is going to have a significant impact on how people bet on sports in New York.
