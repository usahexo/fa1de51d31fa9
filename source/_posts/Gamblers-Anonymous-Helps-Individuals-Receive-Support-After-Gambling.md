#  Recovery From Gambling Addiction Begins with Gamblers Anonymous

It’s not easy admitting that you have a problem, but it’s the first step on the road to recovery from gambling addiction. That’s why Gamblers Anonymous (or GA) is such an important organization for recovering addicts.

GA is a self-help group modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous. It’s open to anyone who has a gambling problem, and there are no fees or dues. Meetings are held all over the world, and they provide a supportive environment where addicts can share their experiences and learn from each other.

One of the key principles of GA is that addiction is a disease, not a personal failing. This helps addicts to understand that they’re not alone, and that there is hope for recovery. The support of other addicts is essential for long-term success, and GA meetings provide that support.

If you or someone you know is struggling with gambling addiction, GA can be an invaluable resource. It’s not easy to break free from addiction, but with the help of GA, it can be done.
