#  Eintracht Frankfurt Looks to Regain Footing After Early Struggles

Eintracht Frankfurt entered the Bundesliga season with high expectations but have struggled through the first few months, currently sitting in 12th place. The club has seen a number of changes this season, including a new head coach and a number of new players.

The team looked to get back on track in their last match, playing Hoffenheim. They came close to taking the lead early on, but Andrej Kramaric was able to find the net and give Hoffenheim the lead. Eintracht Frankfurt was not able to find an equalizer and lost 1-0.

This loss puts them further behind in the race for a spot in European competition next season. To make matters worse, they now face a difficult matchup against Bayern Munich, who are currently in first place in the Bundesliga.

Eintracht Frankfurt will need to improve their play if they want any chance of winning against Bayern Munich. They will need to be able to create more chances and take advantage of their opportunities. Additionally, they will need to shore up their defense and make sure that they don’t concede any goals.

If they are able to do all of this, they may be able to pull off an upset against Bayern Munich. However, it will be a difficult task, especially considering how well Bayern Munich is playing this season.

#  Eintracht Frankfurt finding their stride as they make a playoff push

Eintracht Frankfurt sit in fifth place in the Bundesliga as they make a late playoff push. The club has been one of the most inconsistent sides in the league, but they have found some form as of late.

Their offense has been clicking, averaging 2.1 goals per game in their past six matches. Sebastien Haller has led the way with 18 goals this season, but Andriy Yarmolenko, Luka Jovic and Sebastian Rode have also chipped in.

 Defensively, they have been a little more suspect, allowing 1.8 goals per game in their past six games. However, goalkeeper Kevin Trapp has been solid between the sticks, making crucial saves when needed.

The club will need to keep up their good play as they currently sit just two points above the relegation playoff spot. Up next for Frankfurt is a home match against SC Freiburg.

#  Sports betting proving fruitful for Eintracht Frankfurt in Las Vegas

Eintracht Frankfurt has seen some major success in Las Vegas when it comes to sports betting. The German Bundesliga club has had a fruitful relationship with MGM Resorts International, which operates several casinos in Sin City.

Frankfurt opened an office in Las Vegas back in 2017 and has been successfully taking advantage of the city’s sports betting market ever since. The team’s director of business development, Stephan Grünewald, recently spoke about the club’s successes in the Nevada gambling mecca.

"Our cooperation with MGM is very good," said Grünewald. "The casino operator gives us fantastic support - including tickets to major events and hospitality suites - and that's really helped us to build up a strong presence here."

Grünewald also highlighted the importance of Kroenke Sports & Entertainment's decision to add MGM as a partner for its Arsenal FC soccer team earlier this year. That move gave Frankfurt even more competition in the race to become the top sports betting destination for fans of the English Premier League (EPL).

However, Frankfurt has still managed to hold its own against Arsenal and other top teams in Las Vegas. In fact, the club has generated over €1 million in revenue from bets placed on EPL matches alone. That figure is even more impressive when you consider that Eintracht Frankfurt is not one of the top clubs in Europe.

The German side's success in Las Vegas can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, MGM Resorts International has been very aggressive in promoting Frankfurt at its casinos. The company has also offered some great incentives for fans of the club to visit its properties.

Secondly, there is a large population of German expats living in Las Vegas. This group provides a natural fanbase for Frankfurt, especially when it comes to betting on Bundesliga matches. Finally, the city's large population and plethora of gambling venues makes it an ideal destination for fans looking to bet on sports.

#  Late surge puts Eintracht Frankfurt in good position for Bundesliga playoffs

Eintracht Frankfurt have enjoyed a late surge in the Bundesliga, putting them in good position for the playoffs.

The Eagles kicked off their campaign with just two wins from their opening six games. However, they have since gone on to win six of their last nine games to move up to eighth in the table.

This late surge has seen them overhaul both Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg, who occupy the final two qualification spots for next season’s Champions League.

And with just three games remaining, Frankfurt are now favourites to clinch one of those coveted spots.

Their final fixtures see them take on Werder Bremen, Hoffenheim and Borussia Monchengladbach - all sides who are currently below them in the table.

While it is still possible for them to miss out on a top-six finish, their current form suggests they will most likely secure a place in the playoffs.

Another positive sign for Frankfurt is that they have been largely injury-free this season. Their only major absentee has been striker Sebastien Haller, who has missed most of the campaign through injury.

Haller has since returned to action and scored twice in Saturday’s 3-1 victory over Nurnberg. This strike took his tally for the season to nine goals, making him the club’s top scorer.

With Haller back firing on all cylinders and the rest of the squad fit and playing well, Frankfurt will be confident of securing a playoff spot in the coming weeks.

#  Bundesliga odds: Can Eintracht Frankfurt keep up the momentum in the sports betting scene?

The Bundesliga enters its third gameweek of the season, and Eintracht Frankfurt are one of the early frontrunners. They have been in excellent form so far, picking up seven points from their opening three games. This has seen them installed as fourth favourites to win the Bundesliga title with some online sportsbooks, such as Betway Sports.

The only team ahead of them in the betting odds are defending champions Bayern Munich. Die Roten have been somewhat shaky so far this season but still remain clear favourites at 5/4 with most bookies. Borussia Dortmund, who lost to Frankfurt in their last match-up, are second favourites at 6/1.

Frankfurt’s next opponents are RB Leipzig. Julian Nagelsmann’s side have had a mixed start to the season – winning two and losing two of their opening four games. They are currently sixth favourites to win the league, priced at 10/1 with Betway Sports. Leipzig will be looking for revenge after they were beaten 2-0 by Frankfurt in the opening game of the season.

Other contenders for the Bundesliga title include Bayer Leverkusen (16/1), Wolfsburg (25/1) and Werder Bremen (33/1).
