#  Taxpayers in Malta Can Now Prove Gambling Losses to Reduce Their Taxable Income 

In a recent development, the Maltese government has amended its tax legislation to allow taxpayers to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income. This amendment came into effect on January 1, 2019 and is applicable to both corporate and individual taxpayers.

This amendment was made in response to feedback received from the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), which pointed out that the current tax system does not take into account gambling losses incurred by taxpayers. As a result, taxpayers are at a disadvantage when compared to other forms of entertainment, such as cinema or theatre visits, where losses can be deducted from taxable income.

The MGA also pointed out that the current tax system does not reflect the fact that gambling is a form of entertainment that is enjoyed by many people in Malta. By allowing taxpayers to deduct gambling losses from their taxable income, the government is recognizing this fact and providing parity between different forms of entertainment.

The amendment applies to all types of gambling, including online gambling and casino games. Gambling losses can be deducted up to the amount of gambling profits generated in a given year. If a taxpayer has no gambling profits in a given year, then their total losses can be deducted from their taxable income.

This amendment is good news for taxpayers in Malta, as it allows them to reduce their taxable income by up to €5,000 annually. This could save taxpayers thousands of euros in taxes each year.

#  How to Prove Gambling Losses for Tax Purposes in Malta 

When it comes to tax, there are many things that people need to take into account. One of these is the fact that gambling losses can be deducted from taxable income. This article will explain in detail how to prove gambling losses for tax purposes in Malta.

In order to deduct gambling losses from your taxable income, you must be able to provide evidence to the Maltese tax authorities that the losses were incurred whilst gambling. This evidence could be in the form of:

- a signed declaration from the gambler stating that the losses were incurred whilst gambling; or
- documentation from the gambling operator (e.g. a betting slip or casino chip purchase receipt) detailing the date, amount and nature of the gambler's losses.

If you cannot provide evidence that your gambling losses were incurred in Malta, then they cannot be deducted from your taxable income here. In such cases, you may be able to claim the losses in your country of residence instead - check with your local tax authority for more information.

#  Tax-Free Gambling in Malta? You Bet! 

Malta has been positioning itself as a tax-free haven for online gambling companies in recent years, and the move is paying off. In 2017, the Maltese government generated €27.9 million in tax from the gambling industry, a 20% increase from the year before. And with new regulations that have made Malta even more attractive to online gambling companies, that number is only expected to grow.

So why is Malta so attractive to online gambling companies? For one, Malta has been at the forefront of developing innovative regulations for the industry. In 2017, for example, Malta introduced new regulations that allow online gambling companies to operate in multiple jurisdictions. This allows companies to offer their services across different countries without having to set up separate operations in each one.

Malta has also been very proactive in developing its blockchain industry. In fact, the Maltese government has gone so far as to declare that it will be the “world’s first country to fully regulate blockchain technology”. This makes Malta an attractive destination for companies looking to develop blockchain applications, since they can be sure that their projects will be compliant with all relevant regulations.

Finally, Malta offers a very favourable tax regime for online gambling companies. In particular, online gaming companies are exempt from corporate income tax and value-added tax. This makes Malta a much more favourable destination than places like Gibraltar and the UK, which have higher corporate income taxes and value-added taxes.

All of these factors have made Malta into one of the most popular destinations for online gambling companies. And with its favourable tax regime and innovative regulatory framework, it is likely to remain so for many years to come.

#  How to Claim gambling losses on your Maltese Tax Return 

If you're a Maltese resident, and you've incurred losses from gambling activities in the previous tax year, you can claim those losses on your Maltese tax return. 

To claim your gambling losses, you'll need to complete and submit form C.19, which is available from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) website. 

The form asks for details of your gambling activities, including the dates of each activity, the amount of money lost, and the type of gambling. 

You must also include supporting evidence for your claims, such as casino statements or betting slips.

Bear in mind that you can only claim losses up to the amount of money that you've won from gambling activities. So if you've incurred losses of €1,000, but have also won €900 from gambling in the same year, you can only claim back the €100 difference. 

Once you've completed and submitted form C.19, the IRD will review your claim and let you know whether it's been approved or not. 

If your claim is approved, the IRD will issue a tax refund for the amount of your losses. 

So if you're a Maltese resident with gambling losses in the previous tax year, make sure to complete and submit form C.19 to be able to claim those losses back on your tax return.

#  Gambling away your tax bill – how to prove your losses in Malta

The Maltese tax system is famously friendly to gambling investors. If you can prove you incurred losses gambling in Malta, you may be able to offset these against your taxable income. In this article, we explain how to prove your losses and what information you will need to provide to the tax authorities.

**The first step is to keep a detailed diary of all your gambling activities.** This should include the dates and amounts of each bet or wager, as well as any winnings or losses. It is also important to record the source of your funds (e.g. whether it was from taxed income or capital gains).

**You will also need to provide evidence of your gambling activities.** This could include casino records, betting slips, tickets for lotteries or other draws, and even screenshots of internet betting activities. If you are claiming losses for foreign gambling, you will need to provide proof that the gambling took place in a licensed venue and that the profits were not repatriated back to Malta.

Once you have compiled all this information, you can submit it to the Maltese tax authorities as part of your annual tax return. They will review it and may ask for additional clarification if needed. If they agree that your losses are valid, they will issue a certificate which can be used to offset your taxable income.

The Maltese tax system is one of the most favourable in Europe for gambling investors. By proving your losses, you may be able to reduce your tax bill and keep more of your profits.
