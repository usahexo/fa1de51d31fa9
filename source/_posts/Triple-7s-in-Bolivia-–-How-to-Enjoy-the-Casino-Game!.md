#  A Fun Way to Play Triple 7s in Bolivia!

There’s a great way to play Triple 7s in Bolivia and have some fun while you’re at it! The game is called Truco and it’s a national pastime in the country. The basic premise of the game is to score points by taking tricks with cards that add up to seven. If you can collect all sevens, you win the game!

The first step is to gather a few friends together for a game. You’ll need at least four people to play, but the more the merrier! Then, you’ll need to get a deck of cards and some chips or money to bet with. Once you have everything ready, it’s time to start playing!

The person who deals the cards first is called el mano and they will deal out eight cards to each player. The rest of the deck is placed face down in the middle of the players. The player on the dealer’s left starts the game by flipping over their top card. This card is then added to the card currently at the bottom of the deck, creating a new stack.

The player on the left then flips over their next card. If this card matches the number on top of the new stack, they take the entire stack and add it to their hand. If not, they simply flip over another card and add it to the new stack. When they can no longer flip over cards, they must draw from the deck until they can play.

If at any point they draw a seven, they can set it aside as part of their hand. The next player then flips over their card and tries to take as many cards as possible from either end of the new stack. If they can grab all sevens from either end, they automatically win! However, if someone else grabs one or more of those sevens first, then whoever takes them takes control of the game.

As an additional wrinkle, there are two other types of cards that can be played during Truco – los valetes (jacks) and las damas (queens). When either of these are played, they automatically take control of all cards in play. For example, if someone plays a queen and there are four other queens in play, she takes them all! This type of move can often change the course of a game so be on your toes!

Truco is a great way to spend an afternoon with friends – it’s fun, fast-paced, and always exciting! So round up some pals and head on down to Bolivia for an unforgettable gaming experience!
