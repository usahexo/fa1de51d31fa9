The first casinos outside of Europe and North America were established in 1990s in countries such as Australia and Malaysia.

The Lesotho Sun is one of the newer casinos on the scene having opened its doors to guests on July 1st, 2017.

The construction of the Lesotho Sun created 1 200 jobs during its build phase with a further 600 people employed once it commenced operations. It is estimated that the casino will contribute M4 billion annually (US$285 million) to Lesotho's GDP which will make it one of that country's largest economic drivers.
