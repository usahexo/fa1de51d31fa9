#  PokerStars Players Flock To Guyana In Search Of 21

Only a few weeks ago, PokerStars announced their intentions to run a poker tournament in the small South American country of Guyana. The event, which will take place from February 21-25 at the Pegasus Casino Resort, is expected to draw some of the top players in the world.

The tournament will have a buy-in of $21,000, with a guaranteed prize pool of $1 million. There will also be a number of side events, including a $10,000 no-limit hold’em event and a $5,000 pot-limit Omaha event.

Guyana is located on the northeast coast of South America and is home to just over 750,000 people. It has long been known as one of the most unregulated and corrupt countries in the region, but in recent years has taken steps to clean up its act.

The government of Guyana is hoping that the PokerStars tournament will help put the country on the map and attract more tourists and investors. They are offering a number of incentives for players who wish to participate in the event, including free airfare and lodging.

Guyana isn’t the first small country to host a major poker tournament. Montenegro hosted an event last year that drew some of the biggest names in poker, including Daniel Negreanu and Phil Ivey. And earlier this month, Malta played host to an event that was won by Chris Moorman.

These tournaments are important for small countries because they offer a chance to showcase their tourism destinations and business opportunities to a global audience. PokerStars is expected to broadcast live feeds of many of the events from Guyana, which should help generate even more interest in the country.

#  Blackjack Proven A Winning Formula In Guyana

In Guyana, blackjack is seen as an important part of the culture and a popular game to play. The casinos in Guyana offer both American and European blackjack games, which often lead to heated discussion among players about which version is better.

Blackjack is actually a very simple game to understand and play. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 without going over, and beat the dealer’s hand. Players are dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one down. Players can either hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with what they have). If a player goes over 21, they lose automatically.

Casinos in Guyana often offer table limits of $500 or $1,000. There are usually between six and eight players at each table, with each player playing against the dealer. Blackjack is generally a fast-paced game, so players need to be decisive when making their choices.

There are lots of strategies that players can use in blackjack, but some basic tips include always splitting Aces and 8s, never splitting 5s or 10s, and never taking insurance. Experienced players also know when to surrender if they have a bad hand.

The strategy that you choose should be based on your own playing style and the rules of the casino where you are playing. For example, if you are playing in a casino that allows re-splitting of Aces, then you would want to use a different strategy than if you were playing in a casino that does not allow this option.

Most casinos in Guyana offer blackjack tournaments for players who want to test their skills against other players. These tournaments can be either single or multi-player events, and can have buy-ins ranging from $10 to $100. Prizes for these tournaments can vary from the host casino’s promotional fund, to cash payouts, to merchandise prizes.

Blackjack is definitely a fun game that can be enjoyed by both novice and experienced players alike. With its simple rules and adrenaline-pumping gameplay, it’s no wonder why blackjack is such a popular choice at casinos around the world

#  Poker Stars Take On Guyana's Blackjack Scene

Guyana has been a hot spot for poker in recent years, with major stars like Daniel Negreanu and Phil Ivey making appearances in the local casinos. But what about blackjack?

While poker is undoubtedly the king of casino games in Guyana - and around the world - blackjack is also a hugely popular choice, thanks to its relatively simple rules and fast-paced gameplay. And Poker Stars is looking to capitalise on this by launching its own blackjack tournament series next month.

The series, which will take place at Casino Guyana from November 5-11, will see 12 top blackjack players compete for a share of the $100,000 prize pool. The action will be streamed live on PokerStars Twitch channel, so fans can follow all the action from the comfort of their homes.

Among those competing for the title will be defending champion Lin "sharky" Chen, as well as top local players such as Harry Paul and Omari Johnson. There's sure to be some stiff competition, but anyone who can take down Chen will certainly have earned their place in history.

#  Guyana The Place To Be This Weekend For Poker Fans

The Caribbean poker hotspot of Guyana is the place to be this weekend for poker fans, as the country hosts the highly anticipated first-ever Caribbean Poker Championship (CPC).

The three-day event, which kicked off on Thursday at the Pegasus Casino Resort in Georgetown and will culminate with a final table on Saturday night, is expected to draw some of the region’s top players.

Poker pro and World Series of Poker (WSOP) Circuit ring winner Jonathan Little is among those scheduled to take part, as well as prominent regional players such as Trinidad & Tobago’s own Cem Topakli and Suriname’s Michael Schiep.

One of the primary attractions of the CPC is its sizable US$200,000 guaranteed prize pool, with the winner set to take home no less than US$30,000. The tournament will also award coveted seats to this year’s WSOP Global Casino Championship in Las Vegas.

Guyana has long been known as a prime destination for poker enthusiasts, largely due to its relaxed gambling laws and plethora of quality casinos. The Caribbean nation recently made waves in the poker world by hosting both the Latin American Poker Tour (LAPT) and South American Poker Tour (SAPT) stop in 2017.

Georgetown played host to a number of high-profile tournaments last year, including an exciting $1,050 buy-in main event that saw Argentina’s Matias Alejandro Ruiz crowned champion.

#  Guyana Becomes Center Of The Poker Universe

Guyana, a small country on the northeast coast of South America, has been thrust into the poker spotlight in recent years. The tiny nation, which is home to less than 800,000 people, has produced some of the world’s best poker players.

Leading the charge is 2008 World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet winner Shaun Deeb. Deeb, who was born in Alabama but moved to Guyana at a young age, is one of the most successful tournament players in the world. He has more than $8 million in career earnings, including over $3 million from cashes at the WSOP.

Another top player from Guyana is Amir Lehavot. Lehavot, who was born in Israel but also grew up in Guyana, has over $6 million in career earnings. He finished 3rd in the 2013 World Series of Poker Main Event and won more than $3.7 million.

Guyana has also produced several other top tournament players, including Christopher Kruk, Paul Berende and Bryan Paris. These players have all had success both at live tournaments and online poker sites.

What is it about this small country that has produced so many talented poker players? There are no clear answers, but several factors could be contributing to Guyana’s poker success.

For one thing, Guyana is a great place to play poker. The country is well-known for its relaxed gambling laws, which allow for a thriving poker scene. This relaxed atmosphere may encourage people to try their hand at poker – and some of them may be very good at it.

Guyana also has a rich history of poker playing. Poker has been popular in the country for many years and there are a number of well-known local clubs where people can play cards games like Hold’em and Omaha. This long history of playing poker may help to cultivate talent and build strong skills among the country’s population.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is clear that Guyana is becoming a center of the global poker universe. The country’s talented players are making their mark on the professional scene and bringing international attention to their homeland.
