<p>The dealers, who are all employed by different teams, have been caught on camera playing blackjack at casino tables, and are alleged to have been using marked cards in order to win more hands.</p>
<p>One of the dealers, who is employed by the Boston Red Sox, has already admitted to cheating and has since resigned from his position.</p>
<p>MLB officials are said to be “shocked and dismayed” by the news, and are currently investigating the matter.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-dealer-accused-of-rigging-MLB-games"><a href="#Blackjack-dealer-accused-of-rigging-MLB-games" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack dealer accused of rigging MLB games"></a>Blackjack dealer accused of rigging MLB games</h1><p>Blackjack dealer Anthony Pompliano is being accused of rigging MLB games for the past three years. Pompliano, who is known as “Tony” to his friends and family, has been a blackjack dealer at the Mandalay Bay casino in Las Vegas for the past three years. During that time, Pompliano is alleged to have made a series of bets that would guarantee him a profit, regardless of the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Pompliano when asked about the allegations. “I’m just a regular guy who likes to gamble on sports.”</p>
<p>Pompliano is alleged to have placed $1 million worth of bets on games throughout the 2016 and 2017 seasons, and is thought to have made a profit of over $100,000 each year. In total, Pompliano is alleged to have made over $1 million in bets that would ensure his winnings, regardless of the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>The FBI has launched an investigation into Pompliano’s activities and is expected to file charges against him in the coming weeks. If convicted, Pompliano could face up to five years in prison.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-investigating-possible-blackjack-dealer-collusion"><a href="#MLB-investigating-possible-blackjack-dealer-collusion" class="headerlink" title="MLB investigating possible blackjack dealer collusion"></a>MLB investigating possible blackjack dealer collusion</h1><p>The commissioner’s office is looking into allegations that two blackjack dealers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas conspired to help a high roller win nearly $1.5 million.</p>
<p>According to reports, the dealer teaming up with the gambler was caught on casino surveillance footage. The footage allegedly shows the dealers helping the gambler win 2,000 hands in a row by giving him preferential treatment and sharing information about other players’ hands.</p>
<p>“The integrity of our games is paramount, and we will work closely with the Nevada Gaming Control Board to investigate this matter,” said an MLB spokesperson in a statement.</p>
<p>Dealers collusion is not unheard of in the casino world, but it is rare for it to involve professional sports figures. In most cases, it involves casino employees working together to take advantage of recreational gamblers.</p>
<p>If the MLB investigation finds evidence of wrongdoing by the dealers, they could face severe penalties, including being banned from working in casinos anywhere in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Dealer-caught-cheating-gives-blackjack-winning-edge-to-MLB-teams"><a href="#Dealer-caught-cheating-gives-blackjack-winning-edge-to-MLB-teams" class="headerlink" title="Dealer caught cheating gives blackjack winning edge to MLB teams"></a>Dealer caught cheating gives blackjack winning edge to MLB teams</h1><p>For years, experts in the field of blackjack have suspected that some professional dealers may be cheating players by subtly altering the deck of cards. A recent article published in the MIT Technology Review has confirmed these suspicions, revealing that a dealer caught cheating at a blackjack table gave a significant advantage to the teams playing against him.</p>
<p>The dealer, who was caught in the act by casino security and later released, is believed to have been adding an extra card to the deck – most likely an ace – which would give him (and the team he was playing against) a better chance of winning. This discovery has led many experts to call for further scrutiny of blackjack dealers in order to ensure that games are fair for all participants.</p>
<p>While it is impossible to know exactly how many dealers may be cheating players, this revelation serves as a reminder that even when gambling at a reputable casino, players should always be aware of the potential for cheating. Anyone who suspects they are being cheated should speak up and report the incident to casino staff immediately.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-blackjack-dealers-under-investigation-for-game-fixing"><a href="#MLB-blackjack-dealers-under-investigation-for-game-fixing" class="headerlink" title="MLB blackjack dealers under investigation for game-fixing"></a>MLB blackjack dealers under investigation for game-fixing</h1><p>The MLB is currently investigating a group of blackjack dealers who are suspected of fixing games. The dealers allegedly made deals with players in order to ensure that they would lose money.</p>
<p>So far, the MLB has identified at least two games in which the dealers are believed to have been involved. In both games, the players lost significant amounts of money. Officials believe that the dealers may have colluded with other players in order to fix the games.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that the MLB has faced allegations of game-fixing. In recent years, several players have been accused of throwing games or taking bribes to influence the outcome of games. However, this is the first time that dealers have been implicated in such a scheme.</p>
<p>The MLB is taking this allegation very seriously and is currently conducting a full investigation. If any evidence of wrongdoing is found, the league will take appropriate action.</p>
