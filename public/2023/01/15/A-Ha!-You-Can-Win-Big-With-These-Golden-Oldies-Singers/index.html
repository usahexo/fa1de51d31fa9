<h1 id="Bingo-Blitz-Commercial-Hits-All-The-Right-Notes"><a href="#Bingo-Blitz-Commercial-Hits-All-The-Right-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Blitz Commercial Hits All The Right Notes"></a>Bingo Blitz Commercial Hits All The Right Notes</h1><p>It’s not often that commercials are so enjoyable that they can be watched over and over again. However, the commercial for Bingo Blitz, a popular online bingo game, is one of those rare gems. Starring actress Alison Brie, the ad is both funny and clever.</p>
<p>The premise of the commercial is that Brie is a struggling actress who is trying to get her big break. In order to make ends meet, she takes a job as a bingo caller at Bingo Blitz. Her monologue about the game is both funny and endearing.</p>
<p>What makes the commercial even better is the fact that it’s actually based on a true story. The actress who portrays Brie in the commercial, Alison Brie, is actually married to Dave Franco, who also appears in the spot. The two met while working together on the set of the movie “The Disaster Artist”.</p>
<p>Since it was released, the Bingo Blitz commercial has been viewed over 7 million times on YouTube. It has also been featured on several major news networks, including NBC and ABC.</p>
<h1 id="These-Vintage-Singers-Will-Get-You-In-The-Groove"><a href="#These-Vintage-Singers-Will-Get-You-In-The-Groove" class="headerlink" title="These Vintage Singers Will Get You In The Groove"></a>These Vintage Singers Will Get You In The Groove</h1><p>There’s just something about vintage singers that gets your toes tapping and your body moving. From soulful ballads to upbeat swing tunes, these singers will have you clapping your hands and bobbing your head in no time.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Etta James<br>James got her start in the early 1950s and quickly rose to fame with her soulful voice and powerful performances. She is known for hits like “All I Could Do Was Cry,” “At Last,” and “Tell Mama.” Her music is timeless and will always get your feet moving.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Marvin Gaye<br>Gaye was one of the most influential soul singers of all time. His music is passionate and emotive, and his voice is simply unforgettable. He is best known for tracks like “What’s Going On,” “Let’s Get It On,” and “I Heard It Through the Grapevine.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Patsy Cline<br>Cline was one of the first country crossover stars, and her music has remained popular over the years. Her vocals are powerful and emotive, and her lyrics are full of heartache and longing. Some of her most famous songs include “Crazy,” “Walkin After Midnight,” and “Sweet Dreams (of You).”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Billie Holiday<br>Holiday was a jazz legend who helped to define the blues genre. Her voice was unique and distinctive, and she was a master of improvisation. Some of her most famous songs include “God Bless the Child,” “Strange Fruit,” and “Lady Sings the Blues.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sam Cooke<br>Cooke was one of the first pop stars to cross over into gospel music. His soulful voice is instantly recognizable, and his songs are both heartwarming and uplifting. Some of his most famous tracks include “Wonderful World,” “Chain Gang,” and “Twistin’ the Night Away.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="This-Bingo-Blitz-Commercial-Has-Got-Soul"><a href="#This-Bingo-Blitz-Commercial-Has-Got-Soul" class="headerlink" title="This Bingo Blitz Commercial Has Got Soul"></a>This Bingo Blitz Commercial Has Got Soul</h1><p>I’ll admit it - I am a sucker for a good Bingo Blitz commercial. And the latest one, with its nod to classic soul and Motown tunes, is no exception. </p>
<p>The commercial begins with a sung introduction declaring that “There’s only one game that can take you to heaven!” It then shows people of all ages (and races) enjoying a game of bingo together. The song continues as the scene switches between players happily shouting out B-I-N-G-O and clips of the sights and sounds of different cities around the world. </p>
<p>What I love most about this commercial is that it perfectly captures the joy and community that comes with playing bingo. Whether you’re in a fancy casino or an old folks home, there’s just something special about gathering together to mark off numbers on a grid. </p>
<p>And of course, the catchy song doesn’t hurt either! If this commercial doesn’t have you itching to play some bingo, I don’t know what will.</p>
<h1 id="Watch-These-Classic-Singers-In-A-Cool-New-Commercial"><a href="#Watch-These-Classic-Singers-In-A-Cool-New-Commercial" class="headerlink" title="Watch These Classic Singers In A Cool New Commercial"></a>Watch These Classic Singers In A Cool New Commercial</h1><p>In a cool new commercial, several classic singers are shown performing together in a “virtual duet.” The singers include Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Adele.</p>
<p>The fast-paced commercial begins with Barbra Streisand belting out the opening lines to “Don’t Rain On My Parade.” From there, the other singers join her one by one in a powerhouse performance of the song. Next is Celine Dion singing “The Power of Love,” followed by Whitney Houston’s soaring version of “I Will Always Love You.”</p>
<p>Mariah Carey then takes center stage for her hit song “We Belong Together,” and the final performance is Adele singing “Rolling in the Deep.” As each singer finishes their part of the song, they bow and exit the stage.</p>
<p>The commercial ends with text that reads: “Experience the power of music with our virtual duet. Watch now at Tidal.com.” Tidal is a music streaming service that was founded by Jay-Z and several other artist-owners in 2015. The company has been criticized for its high prices, but it does offer exclusive content from its artist-owners.</p>
<p>The commercial has been praised by music fans for its impressive lineup of classic singers. It’s also been praised for its slick production values and fun concept.</p>
