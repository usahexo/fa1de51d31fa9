<h1 id="See-the-Casino-Film-Phenomenon-Set-in-Lesotho"><a href="#See-the-Casino-Film-Phenomenon-Set-in-Lesotho" class="headerlink" title="See the Casino Film Phenomenon Set in Lesotho!"></a>See the Casino Film Phenomenon Set in Lesotho!</h1><p>Casino phenomena are not only popular in Las Vegas, Nevada, Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Macau but also in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. Casino attractions have been a lure for visitors to these areas for many years.</p>
<p>The first casinos were established in the 17th century in Venice, Italy. Gambling was popular in France in the 18th century. The first casino in the United States was opened in 1776 in New Orleans. Gambling was legalized in Nevada in 1931. In 1968, gambling was legalized in Atlantic City. The first casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip was opened in 1967. Macau overtook Las Vegas as the world’s leading casino center by revenue in 2006.</p>
<p>Casinos are popular tourist destinations providing a variety of entertainment including restaurants, shops, hotels, and spas as well as gaming facilities. The first casinos outside of Europe and North America were established in 1990s in countries such as Australia and Malaysia. Casinos have also been established in Africa with most being located in South Africa and more recently Lesotho.</p>
<p>The Lesotho Sun is one of the newer casinos on the scene having opened its doors to guests on July 1st, 2017. It is owned by Sun International Ltd., a company listed on both the Johannesburg and London stock exchanges. The casino is located at the foot of Thaba Ya Mafika (Mount Qiloane) which overlooks Maseru and offers beautiful views of the city below. The casino complex is spread over two levels with 100 gaming tables and over 900 slot machines. There is also an 8-screen cinema complex and a range of restaurants including an Italian trattoria, a Lebanese grill house, a sushi bar, and a steakhouse. The casino has its own nightclub called Voodoo which offers live entertainment including singers, dancers, magicians, and comedians.</p>
<p>The construction of the Lesotho Sun created 1 200 jobs during its build phase with a further 600 people employed once it commenced operations. It is estimated that the casino will contribute M4 billion annually (US$285 million) to Lesotho’s GDP which will make it one of that country’s largest economic drivers. Sun International Ltd. has already made provision for social responsibility projects worth more than M5 million (US$365 000) which will benefit local communities within a 10 km radius of the casino resort..</p>

Perhaps it’s the allure of flashing lights, loud noises and potential riches that attract us - or maybe it’s just the chance to escape for a couple of hours into a different world.</p>
<p>Whatever the appeal, casino films are some of the most popular movies around. And while there are plenty of them to choose from, few offer the unique setting and culture of those set in Lesotho.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting new film to watch, be sure to check out some of the best that Lesotho has to offer. Here are three of our favourites:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>‘Kingdom’ - This thrilling movie is set in a fictitious Lesotho kingdom and tells the story of two warring factions competing for control. With thrilling action sequences and great acting, it’s sure to keep you entertained from start to finish.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘Yesterday’ - In this heartwarming film, a young girl travels from Lesotho to Johannesburg in search of her missing father. Along the way she meets new friends and discovers things she never knew about her homeland. A great film for both adults and children alike.</p>
</li>
<li><p>‘The Giant King’ - This animated film tells the story of Mofele, a giant who is banished from his home in Lesotho after angering the gods. He must then journey across Africa in search of a new home. Filled with colourful characters and amazing animation, it’s sure to please both kids and adults alike.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="The-Best-Casino-Film-Yet-Shot-in-Lesotho"><a href="#The-Best-Casino-Film-Yet-Shot-in-Lesotho" class="headerlink" title="The Best Casino Film Yet - Shot in Lesotho!"></a>The Best Casino Film Yet - Shot in Lesotho!</h1><p>Casino films are a dime a dozen. So when a new casino film comes out, it’s hard to get excited. Unless, of course, the casino is in Lesotho.</p>
<p>Yes, the small African country best known for its high altitude has become a hotspot for filmmakers looking for an exotic and visually stunning backdrop for their casino movies. And the results have been simply stunning.</p>
<p>Take Mark Dornford-May’s latest film, “Red Money”. The movie is set in a fictional casino in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho. And the visuals are simply breathtaking. From the bright colors of the casino floor to the snow-capped mountains in the background, Dornford-May has created a work of art that rivals anything Hollywood has to offer.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the visuals that make “Red Money” so special. The story is equally compelling, telling the tale of a small-time gambler who gets in over his head with some dangerous underworld characters.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a good Casino film to watch, look no further than “Red Money”. Shot entirely in Lesotho, it’s easily one of the best films of its type yet released.</p>
