From his outrageous (yet wildly funny) antics to his deadpan expressions and line deliveries, Dwight is a scene-stealer.</p>
<p>And one of the most memorable moments in the show comes when Dwight reveals that he suffers from OCD – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This leads to some hilariously awkward exchanges with his colleagues, as they try to come to grips with just how Dwight’s mind works.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, OCD is a mental illness that causes people to have unwanted and intrusive thoughts, as well as engage in compulsive behaviors as a way of trying to control those thoughts. sufferers of OCD often feel immense anxiety and guilt if they are unable to complete their rituals.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there is a growing body of research that suggests many people who suffer from OCD may not actually have the disorder at all. Rather, they may be exhibiting signs and symptoms of another mental illness – such as anxiety or depression – which can sometimes be mistaken for OCD.</p>
<p>This is what is known as “overdiagnosis”, and it can be a serious problem because it can lead to people not receiving the treatment they need for their actual condition. In some cases, it can even lead to people being prescribed medication that they do not need and may even be harmful to them.</p>
<p>So how do you know if you or someone you know might be suffering from OCD? While there is no definitive answer, there are some telltale signs and symptoms that can help you determine if there might be a problem.</p>
<p>Some of the most common symptoms of OCD include excessive washing or cleaning, checking things repeatedly, ordering and arranging items in a specific way, hoarding items, and avoiding certain activities or places out of fear of contamination.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing several of these symptoms on a regular basis, it might be worth considering talking to your doctor about it. They can help you determine if you do indeed have OCD, or if you might be suffering from another condition instead.</p>
<h1 id="Firemen-Play-Poker-at-Montag’s-House-and-He-Can’t-Stop-Rinsing-His-Hands"><a href="#Firemen-Play-Poker-at-Montag’s-House-and-He-Can’t-Stop-Rinsing-His-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Firemen Play Poker at Montag’s House, and He Can’t Stop Rinsing His Hands"></a>Firemen Play Poker at Montag’s House, and He Can’t Stop Rinsing His Hands</h1><p>Montag was having a poker game with his fireman friends at his house. They were in the middle of the game when someone suggested that they go to the kitchen and get some snacks.</p>
<p>Montag got up to go to the kitchen, but he couldn’t stop thinking about how dirty his hands were. He knew that if he didn’t wash them, he would get dirt and grease all over the food.</p>
<p>He spent an hour washing his hands, and by the time he was done, he had missed most of the poker game. He was so embarrassed that he didn’t want to show his face to his friends.</p>
<p>But they all understood. They told him that it was no big deal, and they even joked about how Montag is always so careful about getting things clean.</p>
<p>In the end, Montag was glad that he had washed his hands. It wasn’t easy, but it was worth it to avoid getting grease on the food.</p>
<h1 id="Montag’s-Scrupulous-Cleanliness-Could-be-Causing-Problems-with-his-Friends"><a href="#Montag’s-Scrupulous-Cleanliness-Could-be-Causing-Problems-with-his-Friends" class="headerlink" title="Montag’s Scrupulous Cleanliness Could be Causing Problems with his Friends"></a>Montag’s Scrupulous Cleanliness Could be Causing Problems with his Friends</h1><p>Montag is a character in the novel, Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury. In the story, Montag has been taught to value cleanliness and to obsessively clean his home and himself. He has also been taught not to question authority or think for himself. This has led to problems with his friends, who have begun to avoid him because they find him to be too strange.</p>
<p>In Montag’s society, being clean and orderly is considered more important than being happy or free. Montag’s friends are beginning to realize that they don’t want to live in a society where they are not allowed to think for themselves or be happy. They are also beginning to realize that it is easier to avoid Montag than to try and change him.</p>
<p>Montag’s friends represent the future of society, while Montag represents the past. The friends are starting to realize that they don’t want a future where they are not allowed to be themselves. They are also starting to realize that there is more to life than being clean and orderly.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Night-at-the-Montag-House-Turns-into-a-Routine-Hand-Washing-Session"><a href="#Poker-Night-at-the-Montag-House-Turns-into-a-Routine-Hand-Washing-Session" class="headerlink" title="Poker Night at the Montag House Turns into a Routine Hand-Washing Session"></a>Poker Night at the Montag House Turns into a Routine Hand-Washing Session</h1><p>The Montag household is known for many things, but one of the lesser known facts is that it’s also the home of a weekly poker night. The participants are a rotating group of friends, most of whom are married with children. Inevitably, as the night wears on and the booze flows, the conversation turns to embarrassing stories from their past.</p>
<p>Tonight was no different, as the group recounted exploits from their misspent youth. But as always, there was one story that took the cake - or should we say, took the hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>It all started innocently enough. The guys were just finishing up their fourth game of poker when someone mentioned that they needed to use the bathroom. One of them stood up to head to the powder room and then stopped in his tracks. “Hey, who’s been in here lately?” he asked, looking around at his fellow players.</p>
<p>It turned out that none of them could remember using the restroom recently. And then it hit them - they all remembered seeing someone come out of the bathroom right before they’d sat down to play cards. “It was Mrs. Montag!” one of them exclaimed. “She must have gone in there to wash her hands.”</p>
<p>They all laughed at the absurdity of it, imagining their conservatively dressed and impeccably groomed hostess walking into the bathroom and scrubbing her hands raw at 2am. But then they got serious again and started discussing what they should do about it.</p>
<p>Some of them argued that they should confront her about it - after all, she had blatantly disregarded everyone’s privacy by walking in on them while they were using the restroom. Others felt that it would be better to just let it go - after all, it was only a silly thing that happened once and there was no harm done. In the end, they decided to do nothing and just hope that Mrs. Montag wouldn’t bring it up again at future poker nights.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, Mrs. Montag did mention it again at a later poker night - but this time she had a different story to tell. It seems that she’d been using the restroom right before another one of the players had walked in on her and she’d seen him washing his hands afterwards. “I guess we’re even now,” she said with a smile.”</p>
<h1 id="Is-Montag’s-Extreme-Cleanliness-Ruining-his-Social-Life"><a href="#Is-Montag’s-Extreme-Cleanliness-Ruining-his-Social-Life" class="headerlink" title="Is Montag’s Extreme Cleanliness Ruining his Social Life?"></a>Is Montag’s Extreme Cleanliness Ruining his Social Life?</h1><p>Montag’s extreme cleanliness habits may be ruining his social life. He is always cleaning and organized, but this may come across as obsessive and unapproachable to others.</p>
<p>He has few friends and is often alone because he doesn’t feel the need to engage in social activities that don’t involve cleaning or organizing. This may be because he is uncomfortable around people who are not as tidy as he is.</p>
<p>While Montag’s extreme cleanliness may have some benefits, such as reducing the amount of dirt and germs in his environment, it may also be causing him some social problems. He would benefit from finding a balance between keeping his environment clean and engaging in social activities with others.</p>
