<p>The incident occurred yesterday evening and left players astonished and frustrated. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” said one player. “The wheel just spun around like crazy and landed on zero every time.”</p>
<p>Casino officials are still investigating the cause of the malfunction, but have so far been unable to provide an explanation. “We’re as surprised as anyone by this,” said a spokesperson for the Casino. “We’re doing our best to determine what happened and to compensate our players accordingly.”</p>
<p>Some players have speculated that the wheel may have been tampered with, but no evidence has yet been found to support that theory. In any case, it’s clear that yesterday’s roulette game was not a winner for anyone involved.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Offers-Free-Play-to-Anyone-Who-Wins-on-Zero"><a href="#Casino-Offers-Free-Play-to-Anyone-Who-Wins-on-Zero" class="headerlink" title="Casino Offers Free Play to Anyone Who Wins on Zero"></a>Casino Offers Free Play to Anyone Who Wins on Zero</h1><p>LAS VEGAS, NV - In a desperate bid to fill its casino with customers, the Atlantis Casino is offering free play to anyone who can win on zero. The promotion, which began yesterday and will run for two weeks, has already lured dozens of players to the casino floor.</p>
<p>“We were getting a little worried about our business,” said casino spokesperson Johanna Evans. “But this promotion seems to be doing the trick. People are really excited about it.”</p>
<p>The offer is open to all players, regardless of their previous experience at the casino. In fact, even first-time visitors have a chance of winning free play. All they have to do is bet on zero and hope for the best.</p>
<p>Some people are skeptical that the promotion will be successful in the long run. “It’s definitely brought people in,” said one player. “But I don’t think it’ll keep them coming back.”</p>
<p>Others are more optimistic. “This could be just what we need to turn things around,” said another player. “I’m going to give it a try.”</p>
<p>The Atlantis Casino is hopeful that its latest promotion will help it regain its lost customers and rebuild its business.</p>
<h1 id="Roulette-Player-Hits-Zero-for-the-Ninth-Time-in-a-Row"><a href="#Roulette-Player-Hits-Zero-for-the-Ninth-Time-in-a-Row" class="headerlink" title="Roulette Player Hits Zero for the Ninth Time in a Row"></a>Roulette Player Hits Zero for the Ninth Time in a Row</h1><p>For many people, roulette is nothing more than a game of chance. However, for some players, it has become a way to make a living. A recent article in The Observer tells the story of a player who has now hit zero nine times in a row.</p>
<p>The player, who wishes to remain anonymous, started playing roulette at an online casino three years ago. At first, he only managed to break even. But then, something changed. In early 2017, he hit zero for the first time and has now done so on nine consecutive occasions.</p>
<p>This has resulted in him walking away with over £270,000 in profits. He attributes his success to understanding the odds and using mathematical models to help him make informed decisions about where to place his bets.</p>
<p>He is not the only player to have found success at roulette. There are many stories of people who have beaten the odds and won big prize money. But what makes this particular story so remarkable is that the player has now done it nine times in a row.</p>
<p>This suggests that there may be some skill involved in playing roulette, as opposed to just relying on luck alone. It will be interesting to see if the player can continue his winning streak and take home an even bigger prize next time around.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Employee-Steals-0-from-Roulette-Table"><a href="#Casino-Employee-Steals-0-from-Roulette-Table" class="headerlink" title="Casino Employee Steals $0 from Roulette Table"></a>Casino Employee Steals $0 from Roulette Table</h1><p>A 26-year old casino employee has been charged with stealing $0 from a roulette table at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino. According to reports, the woman was observed on security footage removing cash from the table while she was working. She has been fired from her position and is facing criminal charges.</p>
<p>This incident is just one example of how theft can take place in a casino setting. There are a number of ways that employees and patrons can steal money or items from a casino, and it’s important to be aware of these threats so that you can protect yourself and your money.</p>
<p>Some of the most common types of theft in casinos include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Employee theft - This includes theft by employees who work in the casino itself, as well as employees of companies that provide services to the casino (such as food service or security). Employees may steal cash, gaming chips, or other items from the casino.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Patron theft - This includes theft by patrons who visit the casino. Patrons may steal cash, gaming chips, or other items from the casino. They may also attempt to cheat at games or use fraudulent methods to win money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vendor theft - This includes theft by vendors who provide services to the casino (such as food service or security). Vendors may steal cash, gaming chips, or other items from the casino.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Is-Zero-Really-a-Winning-Number-in-Roulette"><a href="#Is-Zero-Really-a-Winning-Number-in-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Is Zero Really a Winning Number in Roulette?"></a>Is Zero Really a Winning Number in Roulette?</h1><p>When you sit down at a roulette table in a casino, the first thing you’ll probably notice is all of the different betting options. There are dozens of them, but when it comes down to it, there are really only a handful that you need to know to play the game. The most basic bet is the “single number” bet, also known as a “straight up bet.” In this bet, you wager on a single number and if the ball lands on that number, you win 35 times your original bet amount.</p>
<p>But what about all of the other bets? What are the chances of winning if you place a chip on, say, zero? Surprisingly, zero is actually one of the most winning numbers in roulette. In fact, over the course of history, the house edge on zero has been just 2.7%. This means that for every $100 you wager on zero, you can expect to earn back $102.70 on average. So if you’re feeling lucky and want to try your hand at winning big at roulette, put your money on zero!</p>
